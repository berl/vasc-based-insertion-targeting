# Experimental protocol #

#### PREP ####
##### if non-headplated mouse #####
1. induce anesthesia
2. attach headplate
3. do craniotomy
4. IVS does tail vein injection of 50ul dextran Texas red

##### if headplated mouse #####
1. IVS does tail vein injection of 50ul dextran Texas red
2. do craniotomy

#### IMAGE ONE ####
1. target within craniotomy using epi
   * take photo of final location
2. switch to 2p
   * note vertical stage location
3. move **stage** down 120um to find same plane of focus as in epi
4. locate surface by moving stage up and down
   * note offset from original vertical stage location in (2)
5. pre-stack on dm6000
   * make sure saving of Channel 1 is off
6. move vertical stage position back to location in (2)

#### RECORD ####
1. coat electrode in live/dead
2. move mouse from imaging headpost plate to recording headpost area
   * note location of mouse on imaging plate as well as possible
2. base electrode insertion on epi photo of final location
3. insert electrode using manipulator
4. do stimuli
5. remove electrode
6. move mouse from recording headpost area to imaging headpost plate
   * attempt to position mouse the same as before moved

#### IMAGE TWO ####
1. target within epi, based on previously taken epi photo
   * adjust rotation as necessary
   * there should be no need to adjust focus
2. switch to 2p
3. move stage **down** the previously recorded offset between surface and epi
   focus
4. post-stack on dm6000
   * make sure saving of Channel 1 is off

#### POST ####
1. take mouse to IVS for perfusion

# Analysis protocol #

#### TRACING ####
1. Import stack into vaa3d using Import->General image series...
2. Enhance contrast of image using Image/Data->image type->saturate...
3. Gaussian filter the image with a 5x5x5, sigma=2 window using 
   Plug-in->image_filters->Gaussian_filter
4. re-convert image to 8bit using Image/Data->image type->linear rescale...
5. Save image as <designation>-8bitgf5552
6. Close all open vaa3d windows except saved image from (5)
7. Snake trace image using Plug-In->neuron_tracing->snake_tracing_trace
8. Open image from (5) in 3D view (ctrl+v) and drag generated .swc file on
9. Right click on a red trace and click "edit this neuron"
10. Right click on any color of trace and click "change this neuron radius"
11. Enter -1 into the first dialog box
12. Leave the value 5 in the second dialog box
13. Right click on any color of trace and click "finished editing this neuron"
14. Right click on a red trace and click "save selected structure", save as
    <designation>-8bitgf5552-snakewrad5
15. Convert saved swc file to mask using 
    Plug-In->neuron_utilities->swc_to_maskimage_cylinder_unit->swc2mask
16. save mask as <designation>-8bitgf5552-snakewrad5-mask
17. in python, import resize_mask from subtractfound in the bin directory of 
    the validation code
18. run resize_mask(<path to swc from (14)>, imshape=<z, y, x shape of 
    original image>)
19. crop mask image from (16) according to the output from (18), using 
    Image/Data->geometry->crop image (minMax bounding box)
    * if the high z-coord suggested by (18) is larger than the mask, simply 
      use the largest possible value
20. save cropped mask image as <designation>-8bitgf5552-snakewrad5-cropmask
21. Distance transform the cropped mask from (19) using 
    Plug-In->image_filters->Grayscale_Image_Distance_Transform with parameters
    .5, 1, 0, 1 from top to bottom in the dialog box
22. save transformed image as 
    <designation>-8bitgf5552-snakewrad5-cropmask-distance
23. do steps (7-14)
    * trace the distance transformed image from (22)
\    * use the image from (5) for the 3D view and radius fill
    * save the swc file as 
      <designation>-8bitgf5552-snakewrad5-cropmask-distance-snakewrad5
